Query Store — Forced Plans and Force Failures
================================================================================
Purpose:
    List all currently forced plans, force failure counts, and plans that failed
    to remain forced. Use after 04_force_or_unforce_plan.sql or during periodic
    Query Store health reviews.

Output:
    (1) All forced plans with runtime stats
    (2) Plans with force_failure_count > 0
    (3) Query Store option summary for current database

Action:
    force_failure_count > 0: investigate last_force_failure_reason_desc — common
    causes include missing objects, plan not guidable, or incompatible hints.
    Forced plan slower than alternatives: unforce and re-run script 03.

Criticality: Medium
Prerequisites: Query Store enabled on current database
