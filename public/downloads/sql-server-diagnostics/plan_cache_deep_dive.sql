Purpose:        Parses the XML execution plan cache to identify key lookups 
                (non-covering indexes) and implicit conversions (SARGability).
Provides:       Top 20 queries with Key Lookups and top 20 queries with Implicit 
                Conversions, including execution counts and XML query plans.
Importance:     Essential for identifying hidden performance killers that waste 
                CPU and I/O due to data type mismatches or suboptimal indexing.
Interpretation: High "Avg_CPU_ms" for these queries indicates high-impact 
                 optimization opportunities. Check Plan_XML for the specific nodes.
Action: For Key Lookup queries (first result set), create a covering nonclustered index that includes all columns from the SELECT and WHERE clauses to eliminate the lookup. For Implicit Conversion queries (second result set), fix the data type mismatch — typically the application is passing a string (NVARCHAR) to an INT or DATETIME column, or the join columns have mismatched types. Use the Plan_XML column to identify the specific node.
Criticality:    High
