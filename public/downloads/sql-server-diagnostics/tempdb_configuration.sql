================================================================================
Purpose:        Analyzes TempDB file allocations (file counts, uniformity of 
                sizes/growths) and identifies PAGELATCH allocation bottlenecks.
Provides:       TempDB file counts, growth uniformity, active PAGELATCH 
                contention.
Importance:     TempDB is a shared resource; contention here bottlenecks the 
                entire instance.
 Interpretation: Files should match cores (up to 8). Mismatched growth is 
                critical. PAGELATCH waits indicate contention.
Action:         If file count < @ExpectedFiles, add equal-sized data files (1 per core/CPU up to 8). If file sizes are not uniform, resize all files to the same size. If PAGELATCH waits are detected, adding files often resolves allocation contention. Restart is NOT required after adding TempDB files.
Criticality:    High
