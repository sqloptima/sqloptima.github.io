/*
================================================================================
Purpose:        Analyzes active requests to construct a hierarchy of blocking 
                sessions and retrieves recent deadlock events from system health.
Provides:       Lead blockers, suspended sessions, blocking hierarchy (tree), 
                and detailed XML deadlock reports for the last 5 events.
Importance:     Critical for resolving real-time concurrency issues and 
                diagnosing recurring deadlocks that impact application availability.
Interpretation: Root blockers have a Blocking_Session_ID = 0. Target these first. 
                 Analyze Deadlock_XML to identify the specific resources contested.
Action: For active blocking (Blocking_Session_ID > 0), evaluate terminating the head blocker only as a last resort: KILL <session_id>. Investigate the head blocker's query (Open Session_ID query in SSMS) to understand why it holds locks for prolonged periods. For recurring deadlocks, use the Deadlock_XML to identify the objects and lock modes in conflict, then redesign the access pattern.
Criticality:    Critical
