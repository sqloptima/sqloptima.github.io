/*
================================================================================
Purpose:        Monitors Availability Group health, replica synchronization 
                states, failover readiness, and estimated data loss (RPO).
Provides:       Replica roles, sync health, log send/redo queue sizes, rates, 
                and estimated RPO (recovery point objective) in seconds.
Importance:     Essential for maintaining high availability and ensuring that 
                secondary replicas are up-to-date and ready for failover.
Interpretation: Sync Health should be "HEALTHY". High log send/redo queues 
indicate bottlenecks. RPO should be near 0 for sync replicas.
Action: If Sync Health is not "HEALTHY" for any replica, check network connectivity and SQL Server error logs. For high log_send_queue_size or redo_queue_size, investigate the disk I/O on the secondary (log writing) and primary (log generation) using disk_latency.sql. For synchronous replicas, RPO > 0 means data loss risk — ensure the network latency is < 10ms between replicas.
Criticality:    Critical
