/*
================================================================================
Purpose:        Identifies the top 20 statements consuming the most CPU, 
                physical/logical reads, or having the longest elapsed durations.
Provides:       Execution counts, total/avg CPU, logical reads, duration, 
                query text, and associated execution plan XML.
Importance:     Pinpoints the "heavy hitters" in the workload that offer the 
                highest return on investment for query tuning and optimization.
Interpretation: Focus on queries with high "Avg_Logical_Reads" or "Avg_CPU_ms". 
                 Correlate with wait statistics to understand the wait type.
Action: Copy the query text from the top-ranked queries and analyze the execution plan in SSMS. Look for: (1) missing index warnings (green text), (2) table scans on large tables, (3) implicit conversions, (4) key lookups. For queries with high Avg_CPU_ms, create recommended indexes and re-evaluate. For large batches, consider breaking into smaller operations or optimizing the worst-performing steps.
Criticality:    High
