/*
================================================================================
Purpose:        Analyzes current memory allocation, Page Life Expectancy (PLE), 
                memory clerks, and pending memory grants (Resource Semaphores).
Provides:       Instance memory overview, PLE per NUMA node, Memory clerk 
                distribution, Pending memory grants.
Importance:     Memory pressure causes frequent disk I/O (paging), severely 
                degrading performance.
Interpretation: PLE below dynamic threshold ((Total Memory in GB / 4) * 150) 
                indicates pressure. Any pending memory grants indicate severe starvation.
 Prerequisites: Deploy framework objects first (00_Framework/00_Deploy_Framework.ps1) when using shared wait helpers.
Action:         If PLE is below threshold, increase max server memory or add RAM. If pending memory grants exist, review queries with large memory grants via top_resource_queries.sql. For high single-page allocators, check for .NET or linked server connections. For full analysis run memory_bottleneck_deep_dive.sql.
Criticality:    High
