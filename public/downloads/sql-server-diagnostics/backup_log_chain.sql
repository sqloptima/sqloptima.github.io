SQL Server Backup Log Chain Integrity
================================================================================
Description:
    Detects breaks in the transaction log backup chain for FULL recovery model
    databases. A broken log chain prevents point-in-time recovery and can make
    restore operations fail after the break point.

Output:
    Sequential log backup listing with LSN ranges, highlighting gaps where
    first_lsn of the next backup does not match last_lsn of the previous backup.

Action:
    If a log chain break is detected (missing LSN continuity), immediately take
    a new full backup followed by regular log backups. Investigate why the break
    occurred — common causes: log backup failure, database switched to SIMPLE
    recovery, or manual log shrink (SHRINKFILE). Run weekly to catch breaks early.

Criticality: Critical
