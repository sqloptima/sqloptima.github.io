/*
================================================================================
Purpose:        Reports the last full, differential, and transaction log backup 
                timestamps for all online user databases on the instance.
Provides:       Recovery model, database state, last backup dates, hours since 
                last backup, and a calculated backup health status.
Importance:     The most critical script for ensuring disaster recovery readiness, 
                meeting RPO/RTO SLAs, and data protection compliance.
Interpretation: Look for "CRITICAL" or "WARNING" in Backup_Status. Ensure log 
backups are frequent (e.g., < 1hr) for FULL recovery databases.
Action: For databases with Backup_Status = "CRITICAL" (no backup within SLA), take an immediate backup:
    BACKUP DATABASE [DBName] TO DISK = N'path';
    For FULL recovery databases with long gaps since last log backup (< 1 hour is recommended), increase log backup frequency via a SQL Agent job. Schedule daily verification using this script in a monitoring job.
Criticality:    Critical
