05_Post_Restore_Maintenance_Before_CL160.sql
Purpose : Mandatory post-backup/restore maintenance BEFORE enabling CL 160.
Why     : A restore from SQL Server 2016 carries over stale statistics headers,
          outdated histogram steps, and legacy modification counters. Page/row
          counts in sys.allocation_units / usage metadata can also be stale and
          feed Cardinality Estimator formulas incorrectly.

When    : Immediately after restore onto SQL Server 2022, while still at CL 130
          (or before first CL 160 flip in UAT).

Safety  : Test First - FULLSCAN can be long/IO-heavy on large databases.
          Prefer maintenance window. NORECOMPUTE not used (auto-update stays on).

Note    : Stats/indexes/MAXDOP may already be done on some engagements - keep this
          script in the package for future restore-based migrations.
